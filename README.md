TASK DESCRIPTION:
This project involves creating a text generation model using GPT-2 and LSTM. The objective is to generate coherent paragraphs based on specific user prompts. 

1. GPT-2 Model:
   - Utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers library.
   - Generates text given a user-defined prompt.
   
2. LSTM Model:
   - Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Trained on a tokenized dataset to predict subsequent words.

The deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating text generation from both models.
